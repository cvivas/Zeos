An old project at the university for the "OS development" courses. 

It consists of two UNIX modules that gather and show statistics for some UNIX commands. We wanted to know statistics for open, write, clone, close and lseek functions.

The module 1 is in charge of intercepting calls for this functions and measure the execution time and the module 2 is in charge of accessing the statistics.
